In the opened Place Order page:

* Select what you would like to do with base cryptocurrency by impressing \[BUY] or \[SELL] button.
* Enter Quantity of base cryptocurrency
* Enter the Price per 1 (one) base cryptocurrency\

#### **3. Submit order**

In the below example, the OMG/ETH price would have to fall for the buy order to be executed.
